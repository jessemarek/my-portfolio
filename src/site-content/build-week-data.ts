    "What is a Build Week? At Lambda School, a build week is sort of like a test. It is a way to show that you have mastered all of the skills learned during the current unit of instruction. A unit is a one month - or 4 sprints - long block of instruction. It consists of 3 weeks of instruction followed up by a build week. This is where you demonstrate your understanding of all the concepts you learned in a collaborative group project with other students. Each project team is comprised of students at different points along the journey through Lambda School.",
